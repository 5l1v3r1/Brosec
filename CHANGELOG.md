# ChangeLog

## 0.1a _(August 15, 2015)_

- Dependencies
    - Clipboard
        - Swapped out xclip for xsel, which seems to work better. Linux users will need to install xsel for clipboard support.
        - Updated README to reflect this change.
- Features
    - `bros http`
        - New feature added to allow for a simple web server similar to running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
